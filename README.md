# Calling-Open-Meteo-API-to-get-Nairobi-Weather
This Python script fetches and saves the daily maximum and minimum temperature forecast for Nairobi using the Open-Meteo API. It retrieves weather data by sending a GET request with latitude, longitude, and timezone parameters. The response is parsed and structured into a pandas DataFrame, which is then exported as a CSV file named nairobi_weather.csv. The script is ideal for quick weather analysis or automation of local forecast tracking. Requires requests and pandas libraries. Run the script directly to generate the CSV file. Data is timezone-adjusted to Africa/Nairobi.
